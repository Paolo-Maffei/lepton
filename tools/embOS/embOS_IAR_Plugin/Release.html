      This problem is fixed with version 3.82.1 of the plugin.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h2 class="heading2">Version 2.00e</h2>

  <!-- ****************************************************************** -->
  <h1 class="newsbox"><a name="pcorr">Program corrections</a></h1>
  <h2 class="heading2">Version 6.0.6.3</h2>
  <ol class="maintext">
    <li>
      Problem with task sensitive call stack under EWARM fixed.<br>
      Using the IAR EWARM V6.10.2, the plugin did not show the task sensitive call stack of Cortex M CPUs correctly.<br>
      The problem is fixed with version 6.0.6.3 of the plugin which can be used for all EWARM V6 versions.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h2 class="heading2">Version 6.0.6.2</h2>
  <ol class="maintext">
    <li>
      Problem with task sensitive call stack under EWARM fixed.<br>
      Using the IAR EWARM V6.10.2, the plugin did not show the task sensitive call stack of ARM CPUs correctly.<br>
      Since version 3.82 of embOS the call stack of preempted tasks was not shown correctly.<br>
      Both problems are fixed with version 6.0.6.2 of the plugin which can be used for all EWARM V6 versions.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h2 class="heading2">Version 6.0.6.1</h2>
  <ol class="maintext">
    <li>
      Problem with plugin initialization under EWARM fixed.<br>
      Using the IAR EWARM, sometimes the plugin could not be started and the following error message was shown:<br>
      &quot;Could not start embOS-Plugin. The OS_TASK structure is not present.&quot;<br>
      To start and initialize the plugin, it is required to get information about the current task structure in the project.<br>
      It might have happened, that the debugger did not deliver the requested information which then resulted in the error message.<br>
      The method to retrieve the required information from the debugger was modified to fix the problem.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h2 class="heading2">Version 6.0.5</h2>
  <ol class="maintext">
    <li>
      Display errors under Windows 7 corrected.<br>
      The previous versions did not show the &quot;Settings&quot; dialog and the &quot;About&quot; box correctly when running under Windows 7.<br>
      The Settings dialog was empty and could therefore not be used. The About box did not show all information.<br>
      The problem is fixed with version 6.0.5 of the plugin.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h2 class="heading2">Version 3.82.0</h2>
  <ol class="maintext">
    <li>
      Memory read error with J-Link fixed.<br>
      Previous versions of the plugin might have produced a memory read error when debugging a connected hardware with external data memory.<br>
      The problem occurred when the external data memory was not accessible directly after downloading into the target memory.<br>
      During initialization, the plugin tried to read some variables from the data memory which failed, as long as the access to the external memory was not initialized by the target application or debug macro function.<br>
      The problem existed in all previous versions of the plugin and is corrected with version 3.82.0.<br>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h2 class="heading2">Version 3.80.2</h2>
  <ol class="maintext">
    <li>
      Display of suspended tasks corrected.<br>
      Previous versions of the plugin did not show the &quot;suspended&quot; state of a task in the task list.<br>
      The problem existed in all previous versions of the plugin and is corrected with version 3.80.2.<br><br>
    </li>
    <li>
      Display of task states of tasks waiting with timeout corrected.<br>
      Previous versions of the plugin did not show the task state when a task was waiting on any object like an Event object, a mail box or a task object with timeout.<br>
      The timeout value was shown, but the task state was not shown in the task list.<br>
      The problem existed in all previous versions of the plugin and is corrected with version 3.80.2.<br><br>
    </li>
    <li>
      Current task was not marked in the task list.<br>
      The running task should be marked with a green arrow in the first column of the task list.<br>
      When embOS version 3.80 or later was used, the arrow was positioned at idle always and did not mark the running task.<br>
      The plugin version 3.80.2 positions the marker at the running task.<br><br>
    </li>
    <li>
      Erroneous permanent update of debugger windows corrected.<br>
      When used with EW-ARM 5.30 or later, the plugin might have forced a window update of all debugger windows after restarting the application.<br>
      This problem occurred when the call stack and task state of a suspended task was examined and the application was started without having the current task selected in the task window.<br>
      The workbench could have crashed or raised an exception.<br>
      The problem occurred when using EW-ARM 5.30 or later and is fixed with the plugin version 3.80.2.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h2 class="heading2">Version 3.80.1</h2>
  <ol class="maintext">
    <li>
      Display of embOS library mode corrected.<br>
      The older embOS plugin might have shown a debug and profiling library, even if only a debug library was used.<br>
      The problem occurred, when an embOS version 3.32b or later was used.<br>
      The new version 3.80.1 of the plugin shows the correct library mode.
    </li>
