To build Nano-X/Microwindows, see src/INSTALL and src/CONTENTS.

The Microwindows Project has been renamed to The Nano-X
Window System, due to conflicts with the Windows trademark
registered by Microsoft, in 2005.

Nano-X is an Open Source project aimed at bringing
the features of modern graphical windowing environments
to smaller devices.  Nano-X's genesis was with the
NanoGUI project, and is now the primary distribution.
Nano-X currently runs on Linux, UNIX, X11, ELKS, MSDOS, RTEMS
and bare VGA hardware.  It uses the same device-
independent graphics engine built for the NanoGUI project.
Nano-X compiles a sample application and the WinCE 
graphics api in about 42k.

The architecture of Nano-X allows it to be ported
or run on a wide variety of systems.  Cross-compilation
for MIPS, ARM and x86 processors is supported. There are currently
screen drivers for Linux 2.2.x framebuffers and Linux 2.0.x
svgalib, as well as an X11 driver that allows applications
to be built and tested under X11 before running on the
target platform.  There exists a portable 4-planes VGA driver
that will run on bare hardware, ELKS, MSDOS, or RTEMS.
There are mouse drivers written for bare hardware, direct
serial port, Linux GPM driver, and touchpads.  The Nano-X
graphics engine is capable of running on any system that
support readpixel, writepixel, drawhline and drawvline,
although more advanced bit blit routines are provided.

Nano-X features full RGB color support, optimized
palette bitmap drawing, and a 3d look-and-feel.
Overlapped and child windows are supported, with complete
window and client area clipping.  Proportional and fixed
fonts are supported, along with utilities for converting
any MS Windows font or .bmp file.  Optimized painting
algorithms are used to allow maximum response while the
user is moving windows on the screen.

In addition, the Nano-X server can also be built on top of
the device-independent graphics engine.
